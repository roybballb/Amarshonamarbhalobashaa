I miss the eye rolls you’d give when something annoyed you, and how it could light my whole day from a thousand miles away. Most of all, I miss us—the gentle rhythm we had before I let my distractions drown it out. I see now how often I left you carrying the weight of both our hearts, and I’m learning, slowly and earnestly, to hold you first.\n",
